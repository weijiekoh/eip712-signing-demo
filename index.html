    <p>
      This page demonstrates how to sign EIP712 typed data using MetaMask and
      verify it in Solidity. Feel free to learn from it and adapt it for your
      dApp and smart contracts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you to Christoph Mussenbrock for Solidity 0.5.0 and variable chain ID support, and Dan Finlay for EIP1102 support.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use this demo, you need at least version 4.14.0 of MetaMask which supports eth_signTypedData_v3.

      Next, copy and paste this 
      into <a target="_blank" href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&version=soljson-v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.js">Remix</a>, deploy 
      it in the Javascript VM environment, and run the verify function.

    <p>
      The signature generated by MetaMask, as well as your wallet address, has
      been inserted into the Solidity code above. The code hashes the data you
      just signed, runs ecrecover with your signature, and compares it with
      your wallet address.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Remix displays <pre>0: bool: true</pre> that's great! Your wallet
        address was successfully authenticated against the signature.
